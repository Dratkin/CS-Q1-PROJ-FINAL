                creator of this website. As you can probably tell, I am a huge horror nerd and I always like 
                to listen to good horror stories. I've always been fascinated about the things that make people afraid and why 
                they make people afraid. This fascination of mine lead me to many different medias of entertainment like movies and pieces 
                of literature however, I mostly read creepypastas and other various forms of horror stories on the internet 
                because of how accessible they are.</p>
